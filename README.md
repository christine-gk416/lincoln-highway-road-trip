# Lincoln Highway Road Trip: Milestone 2

## About this project

The aim of this project is to help people plan a road trip along the Lincoln Highway in Pennsylvania. 

1.	Give people the option to plan a trip that doesn’t require much air travel or public transportation, in line with COVID-19 restrictions. 
2.	Highlight the benefits of an old highway road trip like quirky roadside attractions and locally owned restaurants/hotels. I planned this trip based on a road trip I took back in 2016, so that I could really get to know the most eclectic parts of my home state (the heart of my state) before I moved to Ireland. The core of this project is based on that specific trip. 
3.	Educate road trippers on the history of the Lincoln Highway, which is one of the oldest cross country highways in the US. It’s now mostly bypassed by the turnpike on route 76 in Pennsylvania. One aim of this project is to encourage holiday-makers to stay off the beaten path and explore recent history based off of one road. 

The Lincoln Highway Road trip is a project meant to give people an alternate to public trave during a pandemic, allow travelers to explore attractions off the beaten track, and to allow visitors to learn about the history of the Lincoln Highway/the state of Pennsylvania along the way.

## UX Planning

### Research:

I started this project by researching travel sites that are specifically for planning out a road trip. The purpose of this research was to narrow down specific features that would work best for a road trip instead of destination travel. 

I'm going to cite some of these sites here:

[Roadtrippers](https://roadtrippers.com/)

[The Atlas Obscura Guide to Pennsylvania](https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/pennsylvania)

[The Irish Road Trip](https://www.theirishroadtrip.com/)

[Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor](https://lhhc.org/welcome.html)

### User Stories

User stories are effective for planning out and determing which features will work on the site and which features will cause scope creep. As I worked on this project, I was able to identify which user stories would help me build an effective travel site in the time period for this project, and which features needed to be changed or pushed back to a later version of the site. 

These are the user stories I've identified for the current version of this project:

1.	Ellan wants to have a slideshow of the unique attractions along the highway, so that they can talk their partner into taking a road trip instead of going on a beach holiday.
2.	Julia likes to plan ahead for places to eat and hotels/motels to stay in while she’s on a road trip. She wants to find suggestions for restaurants and hotels directly on the site.
3.	Miles is fascinated by the history of the roadside attractions on the Lincoln highway. He wants to learn more about the general history of the highway and facts about the attractions. 
4.	Skye lives near the Lincoln highway heritage quarter in Pennsylvania and wants to keep up with events at each destination. She’d like to subscribe to a newsletter to get updates. 
5.	Robert wants to have a way to search the map for places to stop along the way. He’s particularly concerned with locating petrol stations, so that the car doesn’t break down and so that he can keep an eye on the cost of petrol.

### Design

**Colors**

To plan the colours for this site, I ran the Pennslyvania flag through [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

Then I used Coolors to desaturate the heavy, government-issued colours of the Pennsylvania state flag into a softer and more modern palette.

Here's the original palette I started with:

I'm also attaching a link to the state flag for reference:

[Flag of Pennsylvania](https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-Pennsylvania)

And here's my completed, softer pallette that was used on the site styles:

The whole site mostly has a background colour of very light blue-grey. To add some contrast between the header and the rest of the site, I put banners of light green or yellow at the top of the page as a banner. I also added altnernating sections of green and light blue on the maps page so that each location section stood out from the one above it on the page. 

The background colours on the site are all light, and I made all text on the site dark to contrast. This makes it easier for site visitors to read the text. Any text area that was difficult to read, I updated to improve my accessibility score on Lighthouse. 

**Logo Design**

The logo colours are the yellow and dark blue used in other areas of the site. 

The logo shape is the keystone, which is an emblem for the state of Pennsylvania (the keystone state). I chose the keystone instead of the generic route symbol used in the US to distinguish the scope of this project. The route sign is used throughout the US, but the keystone is specific to Pennsylvania. 

Inside the keystone, I placed 30 for the name of the route that's assigned to the Lincoln Highway. All routes in the US have a number assigned to them, but only some have specific names like the Lincoln Highway. I also added a map symbol to represent that this website is meant for planning a road trip. 

For the logo, I avoided using the colours or emblems used by the official Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor or Historical organisations. I did this to avoid copyright infringement, as I'm not associated with these organisations. 

**Fonts**

I used Google fonts for this project, and chose fonts that are currently popular on the Google fonts front site: Roboto, Poppins, and Kiwi Maru. 

Roboto is an easy to read and accessible font that pairs well with nearly any font. I used Roboto in my header and footer navigation link areas. 

I chose Poppins for the main text areas of my site because it's the default font used on some website building platforms. It's clear, accessible, and resizes well on mobile devices without needing to be adjusted. Also, I prefer sans serif fonts, so from a design perpective prefer to use them in my design planning. 

In the banner headings near the top of each page, I used Kiwi Maru because it's both bold and quirky. I think it complements the san serif fonts used on the rest of the site, while adding a fun touch to the main headings. 

The reason I used three fonts is that I understand a font pack should remain small and that adding multiple fonts to a site can increas loading time.
